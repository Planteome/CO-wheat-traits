Because it is difficult to evaluate diseases on dead leaves, disease notes should be taken when at least four leaves are still alive and green (soft to mid-dough growth stage).

Often, crop growth in an infected field will be irregular or patchy. Below ground, cereal roots will display generalized root browning, with lesions rapidly coalescing to produce extensive areas of discoloration. Lesions are only readily observed on the roots in the very early stages of infection. Lateral roots will be reduced in both length and number, and the root system may be thin and poorly branched or appear necrotic." []

Avoid border effects by sampling away from edges of plot.  In most cases, determinations of dry mass are made on representative sub-samples to reduce oven space requirement, take additional measurements (e.g., fertile culm count) etc. Several protocols available (Bell and Fischer, 1994; Reynolds et al., 2001; Pask et al., 2012), decide which method suit better for your objectives."

def: ". A sample of 250 grams of flour is mixed with a salt solution to form dough.  2. The dough is sheeted, rested and inflated in the Chopin Alveograph. 2. Five 4.5 centimeter circular dough patties are formed and then rested in the alveograph in a temperature-regulated compartment at 25 degrees Celsius for approximately 20 minutes.  3. Each dough patty is tested individually. The alveograph blows air into a dough patty, which expands into a bubble that eventually breaks.  4. The pressure inside the bubble is recorded as a curve on graph paper. The alveograph determines the gluten strength of dough by measuring the force required to blow and break a bubble of dough. The results include P Value, L Value, and W Value." []
